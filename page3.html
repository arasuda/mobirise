The fact that only 4% of the UK population are registered to donate blood, and even less than that donate blood. This is in stark contrast to the fact that more than 40% of the population gives blood. According to the NHS, 135,000 donors are needed every year; this goal has been reached in the past few years. However, even although the target number of donors is reached every year, the number of people who donate is significantly smaller. Only recently, at the start of this project, there has been an outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19). This, in turn, has led to a decree in donations and donors because of COVID-19. This is a current problem as the amount of blood that the NHS requires every year has not decreased. Most noticeably white blood cell to help people that have naturally weak immune systems to fight the virus. Because of the outbreak, not only as an epidemic but in this case a pandemic, the NHS is in constant need of people to donate blood, not only to test patients' blood to see how it may respond to the virus.</p><p><br></p><p>Nevertheless, to help treat people that may have the virus. Even if there is a current pandemic affecting the world, the NHS still requires blood regularly; because if someone is in a severe car accident, they may require up to 100 pints of blood and the average person can only donate up to 1 pint every for months. As a result, this means that there could be shortages of blood in the future if people give regularly. This, in turn, would lead to people who have a disease like leukaemia loving a much shorter life or having a reduced quality of life.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Wider context</u></strong></p><p>Across the Uk, there has been a decrease in the number of people wanting to donate blood. Of 2,126 people surveyed for why they did not donate blood (2016 NHS survey): 20% believed that they could not donate because they have tattoos, 16% because of piercings, 15% because of smoking and 3 % because of their diet.</p><p><br></p><p>Nationally more and more misconceptions are being spread about blood donation, which has led to less and fewer people either requesting or donating bloodâ€”or reducing the number of times that they donate. This harms the number of people that require blood transfusions. It is a common misconception that people receive blood transfusions because they have had a severe injury; however, people require them for many different reasons such as cancer patients, people who suffer from sickle cell syndrome and women in labour. In most cases of blood donation, it is not to save a person's life, but it is to improve the overall quality of that person's life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>According to the NHS Blood and transplant, it is estimated only 5% of the UK's black, Asien and minority ethnics population donate blood; this is only slightly higher than the national average while the BAME population only consists of less than 20%. Is an issue because there are many different blood-related illnesses such as sickle cell syndrome Littlemore prominent in Minority communities. Especially in black communities. People in the BAME population should donate blood because certain illnesses are more treatable with the blood of someone from a similar demographic. This is because some illnesses are only present in specific communities, or there is a significantly lower chance of catching this illness if a person is from a different heritage to white British people.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u><br></u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Specific context&nbsp;</u></strong></p><p>The objective of these assignments is just knowledge to the public about misconceptions to do with blood donation as well as the benefits of doing so. not just for the person receiving the blood for the person donating it as well. As of 2019, The number of male donors has decreased by almost 25% due to multiple factors, two of which being men are more likely to be afraid of needles (20%) and giving blood (24%) in comparison to women (Hannah Parrots July 11 2019). A fear of needles is prevalent amongst young people growing up that affects many children as well as young adults. However, it is not the needle going into their arm that scares them; it is the thought of how much it hurts. When in reality, most time and needle is involved, the pain is very minute and only lasts a small period. However, this is a strange Factor because men are afraid I am giving blood even though statistically, men are less afraid of blood than women. This is because men are more prone to injury at work, whether a person in sport or day to day life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>When it comes to the donation aspect, more and more doctors are using online social media to explain common misconceptions with blood donation as well as showing people how simple it is for them to register. There are "only four steps, registration, health check, donating of the actual blood and snacks" (doctor mike). Subtracting the registration process that can no longer be filled out in the blood donation centre itself, complete online at home, all other processes can be completed on the day at the blood donation centre. It is usually in the course of about 10 - 20 minutes. This is in stark contrast to the fallacy that blood donation takes a considerable period to register or to donate blood.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In 2018, there was a decrease in the amount of blood that the NHS had. This shortage happened in only two days due to the lack of donors leading up to that bank holiday. This put a massive strain on the NHS as they had to use their supplies of O - blood because they did not have enough Ro blood to reach the demand that was needed. Even though in July 7,000 people volunteered in last year's blood drive, to establish the amount of blood available to the country. It still was not enough as the NHS needed 40,000 black donors alone. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>The work&nbsp;</u></strong></p><p>Because NHS blood and transplant Is a government-run charity organisation, this means that any blood donations would be a voluntary act from the general public. Not showing a constant advertisement to the public could lead to a decrease in the number of people that donate every year. As a result, because awareness is not being spread at schools and universities, this has led to the NHS having to use ways to persuade people to donate blood. Most of these methods involve forms of advertisement such as new forms of advertisement that have been used on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. It was reported in June of 2019 there was a reduction in males donors, up to 25% in over five years. This has been a significant problem as men can donate every 12 weeks, in comparison to women then can donate every 16 weeks. As a result, men can donate 4 pints of blood a year, while women can only donate 3. Not only can men donate more frequently, but men's blood is less likely to cause reactions in patients, it is more stable for platelet and plasma transfusions.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of the decline in the number of men that are donating each year, the NHS blood has focused most of its blood donation advertisements into advertisements that incorporate men/masculinity. If a person were to see a blood donation advertisement, men are less likely to see it from their emotional side "they ten to put themselves in the situation of what if i need blood?" (Tom Aggett, NHS blood marketing director).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The aims of this project, through interactivity and posters, is to bring to light some of the facts and statistics when it comes to blood donation. The development of the work and linking one topic to another is overall essential: as it could create an identity, brand theme and overarching message that will be simple and easy for people to remember. Taking into consideration the material that I will have to work with will limit some of the design that I will be able to make. However, a 'good design is not about what medium you are working in. It's about thinking hard about what you want to do and what you have to work with before you start" (Susan Kare). Taking this into consideration the limitations that I will be provided with such tools like the risograph printer, may make there are pieces more memorable and show that "all blood matters" - an interactive exhibition that shows what blood types can be donated to which types of recipients.</p><p><strong><u><br></u></strong></p><p><strong><u>The practice</u></strong></p><p>When conducting more research into blood donation, the next logical conclusion was to choose where the caiman would be placed. Each of the campaigns had a similar message. However, they did it in different ways that would get the message across to different audiences. The risograph poster was for a generic 18+ audience, that was designed for a universal audience. The 3D model/background with it was designed as part of an exhibition that could be placed in colleges or universities. The animation was designed for students from high school and upwards, and the main target for the pocket provocation was for people age 18+ but mainly for younger blood donors as they are more likely to take keyrings and memorability for places they have been.</p><p><br></p><p>These outcomes were focused on using a limited amount of colour while making sure that the colours were contrasting to bring forward the small amount of information. The choice of placing all the information inside of blood bags is not just because of 'all blood matter', but the information of the blood can tell people what will save a person's life. As a result, the fact labelled on the blood bags will show people from the shocking statistics about blood donation that will persuade more people to want to donate blood. The choice of red black and white from the design is because back contrast with the wit backgrounds and allow the text to stand out more, while the red relates the colour scheme relates to the topic of blood donation. All these pieces were designed with the theory that the human eye is attached to brighter objects- the information would either be in white or surrounded by white.</p><p><br></p><p>When considering the font style chosen, I chose to type out the information after the initial background graphics were created and stuck to a maximum of 2 fonts. As shown in the 'Helvetica' documentary (Hustwit, G. 2007) similar fonts or fonts that had minor contrast to one and other as long as they were related to one and other, would be suitable for the poster that was created. This theory was later expanded upon because certain forms such as the Sans family, were better at titles or short amounts for text because they are much easier to read. As the form block letters that stand out. On the other hand, serif fonts followed a more traditional font the followed similar way to, how people use to write. Taking these theories into consideration, I chose to use fonts like Helvetica, Robot and Arial. This proves a form of familiarity as most types of fonts are exposed to the public regularly, so people are more likely to be able to read these fronts as they are easy to read as well as people would be used to seeing this front on the blood bags as similar fonts are used there. Additionally, the information most showing people the monochromatic colours of blood and the imagery relating to it is in the hope that people will get used to seeing the colour. The goal is to reduce the number of men that are afraid of the sight of blood, as exposing them to the colour and thing relating to blood will cause them to not associate blood with blood having lots of effects on people depending on how it is used.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Conclusion </u></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The focus of this campaign that I created was to bring to light some common misconceptions about blood donation in the UK. It is a disappointment that more and more men do not want to donate blood as often as what was in the past. This is due to a plethora of different reasons. Some are similar concerns that the NHS have; however, people's concerns are a lot greater to the point where they are inaccurate.</p><p><br></p><p>Through the provocation, it will allow people to be able to sign up. Sighting up contains only a handful of questions, that remove many of the fallacies that people have about donation. Moreover, even more, families will be debunked when they fill out the health check at the front of the desk, showing that even if you smoke or take certain types of medication, you are still able to donate blood as long as you meet most if not all the criteria.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Researching these topics show that there are many different effects blood donation can have on a person and the type of people they should donate blood. This research never down the demographic to males age 18 and above. They are using each one of the projects to target a specific demographic. That would allow the campaign to reach a broader audience. The project was successful as it provided information about the shocking statistics of the lack of blood donation and why people do not donate who were showing people that if you overcome the fear of the lad or needles, you can save a person's life if or improve their quality of life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>With more time spent on this, the focus would have shifted to which demographics Should donate blood more often. Are there certain types of diseases that only affect particular groups of people types of Heritage. This would allow the campaign to two illnesses that are more prevalent now unto the Ethical backgrounds that should donate blood to help combat these illnesses.</p><p><br></p><p>Blood is free - so it should be given away freely.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>
