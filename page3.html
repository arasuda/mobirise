            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Blood donation is a global problem, but the focus of this project will be on the UK. Of the 40% of the UK population that is eligible to donate, only 4% are currently registered and even less actually donate blood. The NHS requires 135,000 donors every year and this goal has been achieved in the past few years. Although the target number of donors is reached every year, the number of people who donate is significantly smaller. Only recently, at the start of this project, there has been an outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19). This has led to a decrease in both donations and donors but the amount of blood still required by  the NHS has not decreased. Most noticeably white blood cells are needed to help people that have naturally weak immune systems to fight the virus. Because of the outbreak, not only as an epidemic but in this case a pandemic, the NHS is in constant need of people to donate blood not only for use in general but also to test patients' blood to see how it may respond to the virus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even if there is a current pandemic affecting the world, the NHS still requires blood regularly. If someone is severely injured in a car accident, they may require up to 100 pints of blood and the average person can only donate up to one pint every four months. As a result, this means that there could be shortages of blood in the future if people do not give regularly. This, in turn, would lead to people who have a disease like leukaemia living a much shorter life or having a reduced quality of life.</p><p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Wider context</u></strong></p><p>Across the UK, there has been a decrease in the number of people wanting to donate blood. Of the 2,126 people surveyed for their reason why they did not donate blood (2016 NHS survey): 20% believed that they could not donate because they have tattoos, 16% because of piercings, 15% because of smoking and 3 % because of their diet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nationally more and more misconceptions are being spread about blood donation, which has led to fewer people either requesting or donating blood and reducing the number of times that they donate. This harms the number of people that require blood transfusions. It is a common misconception that people receive blood transfusions because they have had a severe injury; however, people require them for many different reasons such as cancer patients, people who suffer from sickle cell syndrome and women in labour. In most cases of blood donation, it is not to save a person's life, but it is to improve the overall quality of that person's life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to the NHS Blood and Transplant, it is estimated only 5% of the UK's black, Asian and minority ethnics population donate blood. This is only slightly higher than the national average, while the BAME population only consists of less than 20%. It is an issue because there are many different blood-related illnesses (such as sickle cell syndrome) that are a lot more prominent in minority communities, especially in black communities. People in the BAME population need to donate blood more regularly because certain illnesses are more treatable with the blood of someone from a similar demographic. This is because some illnesses are only present in specific communities or there is a significantly lower chance of catching this illness if a person is from a different heritage to white British people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Specific context</u></p><p>The objective of these assignments is to give knowledge to the public regarding the misconceptions to do with blood donation as well as the benefits of doing so. This benefits not just  the person who is receiving the blood but the person donating it as well. As of 2019, the number of male donors has decreased by almost 25% due to multiple factors. The main two reasons for this are that men are more likely to be afraid of needles (20%) and giving blood (24%) in comparison to women (Hannah Parrots July 11 2019). A fear of needles is prevalent amongst young people growing up.  This affects many children as well as young adults. Most often it is not the needle going into their arm that scares them; it is the thought of how much it might hurt. In reality most times a needle is involved, the pain is very minute and only lasts a small time. However, this is a strange factor because while men are afraid of giving blood, statistically men are less afraid of blood than women. This is because men are more prone to injury at work, whether in sport or day to day life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to the donation aspect, more and more doctors are using online social media to expose common misconceptions with blood donation as well as showing people how simple it is for them to register. According to Doctor Mike, there are "only four steps, registration, health check, donating of the actual blood and snacks". The registration process can no longer be filled out in the blood donation centre itself, but after completing the online form at home, all other processes can be completed on the day at the blood donation centre. It usually takes about 10 - 20 minutes for the process to be completed. This is in stark contrast to the fallacy that blood donation takes a considerable period of time to register or to donate blood.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, there was a decrease in the amount of blood that the NHS had. This shortage happened in only two days due to the lack of donors leading up to that bank holiday. This put a massive strain on the NHS as they had to use their supplies of O-negative blood because they did not have enough Ro blood to reach the demand that was needed. In June of 2017, 7,000 people volunteered in that year's blood drive to establish the amount of blood available to the country. This was still  not enough as the NHS needed 40,000 black donors alone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>The work</u></strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Because NHS Blood and Transplant Is a government run charity organisation, this means that any blood donations would be a voluntary act from the general public. Not showing a constant advertisement to the public could lead to a decrease in the number of people that donate every year. As a result, because awareness is not being spread at schools and universities, this has led to the NHS having to use different ways to persuade people to donate blood. Most of these methods involve forms of advertisement such as those that have been used on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. It was reported in June of 2019 there was a reduction in males donors, up to 25% in over five years. This has been a significant problem as men can donate every 12 weeks, in comparison to women who can only donate every 16 weeks. As a result, men can donate 4 pints of blood a year, while women can only donate 3. Not only can men donate more frequently, but men's blood is less likely to cause reactions in patients as it is more stable for platelet and plasma transfusions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the decline in the number of men that are donating each year, the NHS  has focused most of its blood donation advertisements into those that incorporate men/masculinity. If a person were to see a blood donation advertisement, men are less likely to see it from their emotional side but they tend to put themselves in the situation of “what if I need blood?" (Tom Aggett, NHS blood marketing director).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The aims of this project, through interactivity and posters, is to bring to light some of the facts and statistics when it comes to blood donation. The development of the work and linking one topic to another is overall essential: as it could create an identity, brand theme and overarching message that will be simple and easy for people to remember. Taking into consideration the material that is available to work with,  this could limit the outcome of the design. However, a 'good design is not about what medium you are working on; it is about thinking hard about what you want to do and what you have to work with before you start" (Susan Kare). Taking into consideration the limitations of the material available, these limitations may not be a hindrance but in fact make the work more memorable because of its simplicity -  "all blood matters" - an interactive exhibition that shows which blood types can be received by different blood groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>The practice</u></strong></p><p>When conducting more research into blood donation, the next logical conclusion was to choose where the campaign would be placed. Each of the campaigns had a similar message. However, different ways were used in order to get the message across to different audiences. The risograph poster was designed for a generic universal 18+ audience. The 3D model/background with it, was designed as part of an exhibition that could be placed in colleges or universities. The animation was designed for students from high school and upwards, and the main target for the pocket provocation was for people age 18+ but mainly towards the younger blood donors as they are more likely to take keyrings and memorabilia from places they have been.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These outcomes focused on using a limited amount of colour while making sure that the colours were contrasted to bring forward the small amount of information. The choice of placing all the information inside of blood bags is not just because of 'all blood matter', but the information of the blood can tell people what choices drive a person to donate. As a result, labels on the blood bags will show people the shocking statistics about blood donation and should persuade more people to want to donate blood. The choice of red, black and white for the design works well because black contrasts with the white backgrounds and allows the text to stand out more, whilst the red relates the colour scheme to the topic of blood donation. All these pieces were designed with the theory that the human eye is attracted to brighter objects. - the information would either be in white or surrounded by white to draw a person’s eye to the text.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When considering the font style, I chose to type out the information after the initial background graphics were created and stuck to a maximum of two fonts. As shown in the 'Helvetica' documentary (Hustwit, G. 2007) similar fonts or fonts that had minor contrast to one another as long as they are similar font families, would be suitable for the poster that was created. This theory was later expanded upon because certain forms such as the Sans family, were better for titles or short amounts of text because they are much easier to read, as they form block letters that stand out. On the other hand, serif fonts followed a more modern style that is similar to how people used to write. Taking these theories into consideration, I chose to use fonts like Helvetica, Robot and Arial. This proves a form of familiarity as most types of fonts are exposed to the public regularly, so people are more likely to be able to read these fonts. People would be used to seeing this font on the blood bags as similar fonts are already used there. Additionally, the information containing monochromatic colour and red is in hopes that people will get used to seeing these colours. The goal is to reduce the number of men that are afraid of the sight of blood, by exposing them to the colour and things relating to blood, this is done so that they will not associate giving blood with pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p><p>The focus of this campaign was to bring to light some common misconceptions about blood donation in the UK. It is a disappointing fact that more and more men do not want to donate blood as often as people did in the past. This is due to a plethora of different reasons. Some are similar to concerns that the NHS have. However, people's concerns have become so great that they have got to the point of inaccuracy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through the provocation, it will allow people to be able to sign up to donate.. When signing up many of the points are answered within the first five questions removing many of the fallacies that people have about donation. Moreover fallacies will be debunked when they fill out the health check at the front of the desk, showing that even if you smoke or take certain types of medication, you are still able to donate blood as long as you meet most, if not all, the criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Researching these topics show that there are many different effects blood donation can have on a person, not just the donor but on the recipient.. This research never downgraded the demographic to males age 18 and above. By using each one of the projects to target a specific demographic it would allow the campaign to reach a broader audience. The project was successful as it provided information about the shocking statistics of the lack of blood donation and why people do not donate. By showing people that you can overcome the fear of the blood or needles, you can save a person's life if or improve their quality of life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With more time spent on this, the focus would have shifted to which demographics should donate blood more often. Are there certain types of diseases that only affect particular groups of people types of Heritage? This would allow the campaign to highlight illnesses that are prevalent in different ethnic backgrounds and how a person's ethnic background affects their immune response and how blood donation could combat these illnesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Blood is free - so it should be given away freely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u><br></u></strong></p></div>
